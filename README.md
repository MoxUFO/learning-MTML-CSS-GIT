# Heriseon- week 1 Challenge README 

## The Repository 
This repository contained the start code i needed to start our first challenge in this coding bootcamp.
The application seemed to function as it is supposed to but the code contained redundancies and lacked 
proper structure. The app also did not meet current accessibility starndard by images lacking the alt 
attribute. I applied missing attributes and organized the HTML index to have semantics elements.
Lastly, I attendde to th CSS sheet eliminating repeated design features. feel free to create Issues
so we can continue to improve the code.

## challenges i faced 
my biggest challenge was understanding how the content in an element was effected by the CSS sheet,
HTML layout, and the pleacement of semantic elements in the HTML index. I also struggled understanding 
what determined seperations in different parts of HTML and how it should be displayed in the browser.

## what I leanred
I learn that the smallest mistake make a big impact. One misplaced keystroke and the code is out of whack.
Paying attention to what you do is just as important as having the skill to do it. Also that knowlegde is 
only useful when you know how to apply it. The most useful lesson ive learned so far is , the importance 
of the div tag and it's connection to the CSS sheet and live application layout.
